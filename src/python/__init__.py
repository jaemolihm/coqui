 |  Correlated Quantum Interface  |
  --------------------------------

CoQuí python is a lightweight python interface to CoQuí, a software project designed for
ab initio electronic structure calculations beyond the scope of density functional theory (DFT)
for quantum materials.

This python package provides a user-friendly interface to the CoQui library, with parameters directly
parsed to the C++ code and allows for easy integration with other python libraries.

For the pure C++ interface, please refer to the CoQuí C++ documentation [link here].
